Cheetahs (Scientific Name: Acinonyx Jubatus) are super fast cats. Historically found throughout Africa, the 
Middle East, to South Asia, cheetahs are identifiable with their slender bodies, their iconic spots, and the dark 
lines going from their eyes to their mouths. Like most big cats, cheetahs rely on a carnivorous diet and spend 
their time running across the fields hunting for prey. Cheetahs' conservation status is considered to be classified
as "vulnerable" meaning more effort is required to protect these animals.
