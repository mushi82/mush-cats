Tigers (Scientific Name: Panthera Tigris) is a big carnivore found across Asia to even eastern Europe. 
From the Siberian Tiger to the Bengal Tiger, this animal is seen as a sign of strength and resilience throughout 
the world. Bangladesh even has the Bengal Tiger as its national animal! The orange coat with iconic black stripes 
makes the tiger easily distinguishable throughout the world and the various different climates they may be 
found in. In recent decades, many countries have tried to help protect these animals as they suffer from 
deforestation and habitat loss attributing to their dwindling numbers. In fact, species such as the Caspian Tiger, 
the Bali Tiger, and even the Javan Tiger now cease to exist.
