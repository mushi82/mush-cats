Panthers are actually not a species, rather they can be Leopards, Jaguars, or even Cougars based on their print 
and location of where they live. Known for their inclusion in pop culture through movies like "Black Panther" or 
"Pink Panther" or even sports teams named after them such as the "Florida Panthers" or the "Carolina Panthers", 
this cat is very popular although it is not its own species. As mentioned before this cat and its varieties can be 
spotted across the world and the term "panther" is more an umbrella term to include cats with these similar 
features. Like all the cats in our zoo, these felines are considered to be endangered no matter what species they 
stem from.
