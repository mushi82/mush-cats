 Lynx are also another umbrella term for the big cat seen with tufts of fur on their ears and sidechops. 
 The lynx can be either a Canadian Lynx, Iberian lynx, Bobcat, or Eurasian Lynx. These cats are usually found 
 in colder climates. These wildcats are avid hunters with strong jaws and incredible jumpers. Like with most cats 
 in our sanctuary, these cats were also considered endangered and by 2002, it was estimated only 94 Iberian Lynx's 
 existed in the world. Radical conservation efforts have proved to be massively successful as the Iberian Lynx 
 went from almost extinct to now considered to be "vulnerable" due to its population sitting around 2,021 about 23
 years after the initial scare.
